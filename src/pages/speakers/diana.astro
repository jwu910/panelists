  //   "I currently work at Square as a full stack software engineer and my team primarily focuses on web development.  I enjoy the constant growth and evolution of technology because it means that there is always something new for me to learn and apply to my work.  Even more than learning, I enjoy sharing and using my knowledge to help improve people’s lives in practical ways.  I’ve been really fortunate to have people around me that have poured into both my personal and professional growth, and as I continue in my life and career, I hope to be able to do the same for others.",
